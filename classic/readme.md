# SlimARM Classic

This part of project is making board for "classic" ARM processors (Samsung S3C2410AL/S3C2416XH).<br>
Although these chips are out-dated in performance, their cost is ever lower than STM32s while having higher performance than them, making them fit for entry-level ARM developments.<br>

Project status:<br>
```
[ok]SlimARM Classic 2410 (slarm_cls_2410_v1r2)
[stall]SlimARM Classic 2416 (slarm_cls_2416)
```

*Warning: The workaround part of linux running on the board is in a stall state. Look into slarm_cls_2410's readme for detail.
